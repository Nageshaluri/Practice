    <h5>ACT I A Utopian Palm Grove</h5>
    
        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio></h6><p class="Speech">: My poor boy, I see it all.</p>


    
    <h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h3><p class="Speech">:Oh! Scaphio, she is so beautiful. Ah! you smile, for
        you have never seen her. She sailed for England three months
        before you took office.</p>


        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio</h6><p class="Speech">: Now tell me, is your affection requited?</p>

        <h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h6><p class="Speech">: I do not know—I am not sure. Sometimes I think it
            <h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h6><p class="Speech">: I do not know—I am not sure. Sometimes I think it
        is, and then come these torturing doubts! I feel sure that she
        does not regard me with absolute indifference, for she could never
        look at me without having to go to bed with a sick headache.</p>

        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio</h6><p class="Speech">: That is surely something. Come, take heart, boy! you
        are young and beautiful. What more could maiden want?</p>

        <h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h6><p class="Speech">: Ah! Scaphio, remember she returns from a land where
        every youth is as a young Greek god, and where such beauty as I
        can boast is seen at every turn.</p>
        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio</h6><p class="Speech">: Be of good cheer! Marry her, boy, if so your fancy
        wills, and be sure that love will come.</p>
        <h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h6><p class="Speech">: (overjoyed) Then you will assist me in this?</p>
        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio</h6><p class="Speech">: Why, surely! Silly one, what have you to fear? We have
        but to say the word, and her father must consent. Is he not our
        very slave? Come, take heart. I cannot bear to see you sad.</p>
<h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h6><p class="Speech">Now I may hope, indeed! Scaphio, you have placed me on
        the very pinnacle of human joy!</p>

       <h6 class="DUET">DUET</h6> — Scaphio and Phantis.

        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio</h6> <p class="DUET">Let all your doubts take wing—
        Our influence is great.
        If Paramount our King
        Presume to hesitate
        Put on the screw,
        And caution him
        That he will rue
        Disaster grim
        That must ensue
        To life and limb,
        Should he pooh-pooh
        This harmless whim.</p>

        <h6 class=Both>Both</h6>: <p class="DUET">This harmless whim—this harmless whim,
        It is as I/you say, a harmless whim.</p>
<h6 class="Phantis"">Phantis</h6><p class="Speech">: (dancing) Observe this dance
        Which I employ
        When I, by chance
        Go mad with joy.
        What sentiment
        Does this express?
      </p>
      <p class="StageDirection">(Phantis continues his dance while Scaphio vainly endeavors to
        discover
        its meaning)</p> Supreme content
        And happiness!

        <h6 class="Both">Both</h6><p class=Speech>: Of course it does! Of course it does!
        Supreme content and happiness.</p>

<h6 class="Phantis">Phantis</h6><p class="DUET">: Your friendly aid conferred,
        I need no longer pine.
        I've but to speak the word,
        And lo, the maid is mine!
        I do not choose
        To be denied.
        Or wish to lose
        A lovely bride—
        If to refuse
        The King decide,
        The royal shoes
        Then woe betide!
     </p>
     
        <h6 class="Both">Both</h6><p="DUET">: Then woe betide—then woe betide!
        The Royal shoes then woe betide!</p>

        <h6 class="Scaphio">Scaphio</h6><p class="Speech">: (Dancing) This step to use
        I condescend
        Whene'er I choose
        To serve a friend.
        What it implies
        Now try to guess;</p>
